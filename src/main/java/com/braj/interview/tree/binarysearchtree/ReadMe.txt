1. A Binary Tree that has only a maximum of 2 Child Nodes (Left and Right)
2. A Binary Search Tree that follows a specific Order
      2.1 :  If data<=parent node , insert to the left of parent.
      2.2 :  If data> parent node, insert to the right og the parent.

      Due to this property binary tree is extremely faster.(As we know the route to reach the node)

3. Insert --> Above logic #2 to find a spot to insert the new element.
4. There are balanced and unbalenced binary tree. In this situation tree will not be faster.

Here we are considering a balanced Binary Tree.

5. Traversing in a Tree (walking through a tree)
     5.1 : PreOrder Traversing  (Root --- Left --- Right)
     5.2 : InOrder Traversing (Left --- Root --- Right)
     5.3 : PostOrder Traversing (Left --- Right --- data )
